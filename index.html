  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>Al-Bataineh is a Research Scientist at the Gran Sasso Science Institute in Italy. His research lies at the intersection of software engineering and formal methods, with particular focus on automated program repair, fault localization, and software verification. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Western Australia, and holds prior degrees from the University of New South Wales and Jordan University of Science and Technology. Before joining GSSI, he held research positions at Simula Research Laboratory, the National University of Singapore, and Nanyang Technological University.</p>

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>Al-Bataineh's research spans formal methods and software engineering, with particular emphasis on model checking, static analysis, runtime verification, and automated program repair. The central objective of his work is to strengthen the integration between formal verification techniques and practical software development processes. Despite the significant potential of formal methods, their adoption in mainstream software engineering remains limited. Al-Bataineh's research aims to bridge this gap by developing scalable, theoretically grounded techniques that improve the reliability and robustness of software systems. A key focus is on advancing automated program repair to handle complex scenarios, including multi-fault programs, through principled approaches informed by formal reasoning.</p>
